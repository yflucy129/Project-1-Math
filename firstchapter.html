	<h1>1. The Fly Puzzle</h1>

	<div class="scrolling-container">
        <div class="scrolling-text">

	<p><strong>For sheer brilliance, it was hard to beat John von Neumann. An architect of the modern computer and inventor of game theory, von Neumann was legendary, above all, for his lightning-fast mental calculations.</strong></p>

	<p>The story goes that one day somebody challenged him with a puzzle. Two bicyclists start at opposite ends of a road <span class="number-two">20 miles</span> long. Each cyclist travels toward the other at <span class="number-two">10 miles per hour</span>. When they begin, a fly sitting on the front wheel of one of the bikes takes off and races at <span class="number-two">15 miles per hour</span> toward the other bike. As soon as it gets there, it instantly turns around and zips back toward the first bike, then back to the second, and so on. It keeps flying back and forth until it’s finally squished between their front tires when the bikes collide. How far did the fly travel, in total, before it was squished?</p>

	<p>It sounds hard. The fly’s back-and-forth journey consists of infinitely many parts, each shorter than the one preceding it. Adding them up seems like a daunting task.</p>

	<p>But the problem becomes easy if you think about the bicyclists, not the fly. On a road that’s <span class="number-two">20 miles</span> long, two cyclists approaching each other at <span class="number-two">10 miles per hour</span> will meet in the middle after <span class="number-two">1 hour</span>. And during that hour, no matter what path the fly takes, it must have traveled <span class="number-two">15 miles</span>, since it was going <span class="number-two">15 miles an hour</span>.</p>

	<p>When von Neumann heard the puzzle, he instantly replied, “<span class="number-two">15 miles</span>.” His disappointed questioner said, “Oh, you saw the trick.” “What trick?” said von Neumann. “I just summed the infinite series.”</p>
