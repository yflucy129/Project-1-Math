	<h1>3. The Unity of Mathematics</h1>
	
    <div class="scrolling-container">
        <div class="scrolling-text">

	<p>Now back to the larger point: How do series like this serve to connect the various parts of math? To see this, we need to enlarge our point of view about formulas like:</p>

	<span class="number">1 + r + r2 + r3 + … = 11 − r,</span>

	<p>which is the same formula as before with a equal to <span class="number-two">1</span>. Instead of thinking of <span class="number-two">r</span> as a specific number like <span class="number-two">15</span> or <span class="number-two">−12</span>, think of <span class="number-two">r</span> as a variable. Then the equation says something amazing; it expresses a kind of mathematical alchemy, as if lead could be turned into gold. It asserts that a given function of <span class="number-two">r</span> (here, <span class="number-two">1</span> divided by <span class="number-two">1 − r</span>) can be turned into something much simpler, a combination of simple powers of <span class="number-two">r</span>, like <span class="number-two">r2</span> and <span class="number-two">r3</span> and so on.</p>

	<p>"Euler’s formula, spawned directly by infinite series, is now indispensable."</p>

	<p>What’s fantastic is that the same is true for an enormous number of other functions that come up virtually everywhere in science and engineering. The pioneers of calculus discovered that all the functions they were familiar with — sines and cosines, logarithms and exponentials — could be converted into the universal currency of “power series,” a kind of beefed-up version of a geometric series where the coefficients may now also change.</p>

    <p>And when they made these conversions, they noticed startling coincidences. Here, for example, are the power series for the cosine, sine and exponential functions (don’t worry about where they came from; just look at their appearance):</p>

    <span class="number">cos𝑥 = 1 – 𝑥22! + 𝑥44! – 𝑥66! + …</span>
    <span class="number">sin𝑥 = 𝑥 – 𝑥33! + 𝑥55! – 𝑥77! + …</span>
    <span class="number">e𝑥 = 1 + 𝑥 + 𝑥22! + 𝑥33! + 𝑥44! + …</span>

    <p>Besides all the exultant and well-deserved exclamation points (which actually stand for factorials; <span class="number-two">4!</span> means <span class="number-two">4 × 3 × 2 × 1</span>, for example), notice that the series for ex comes tantalizingly close to being a mashup of the two formulas above it. If only the alternation of positive and negative signs in cosx and sinx could somehow harmonize with the all-positive signs of ex, everything would match up.</p>

    <p>That coincidence, and that kind of wishful thinking, led Leonhard Euler to the discovery of one of the most marvelous and far-reaching formulas in the history of mathematics:</p>

    <span class="number">e𝑖𝑥 = cos𝑥 + 𝑖 sin𝑥,</span>

    <p>where <span class="number-two">𝑖</span> is the imaginary number defined as <span class="number-two">𝑖 = −1---√.</span></p>

    <p>Euler’s formula expresses an outrageous connection. It asserts that sines and cosines, the embodiment of cycles and waves, are secret relatives of the exponential function, the embodiment of growth and decay — but only when we consider raising the number e to an imaginary power (whatever that means). Euler’s formula, spawned directly by infinite series, is now indispensable in electrical engineering, quantum mechanics and all technical disciplines concerned with waves and cycles.</p>

    <p>Having come this far, we can take one last step, which brings us to the equation often described as the most beautiful in all of mathematics, for the special case of Euler’s formula where <span class="number-two">x = π</span>:</p>

    <span class="number">e𝑖π + 1 = 0.</span>

    <p>It connects a handful of the most celebrated numbers in mathematics: <span class="number-two">0, 1, π, 𝑖 and e</span>. Each symbolizes an entire branch of math, and in that way the equation can be seen as a glorious confluence, a testament to the unity of math.</p>

    <p>Zero represents nothingness, the void, and yet it is not the absence of number — it is the number that makes our whole system of writing numbers possible. Then there’s <span class="number-two">1</span>, the unit, the beginning, the bedrock of counting and numbers and, by extension, all of elementary school math. Next comes <span class="number-two">π</span>, the symbol of circles and perfection, yet with a mysterious dark side, hinting at infinity in the cryptic pattern of its digits, never-ending, inscrutable. There’s <span class="number-two">𝑖</span>, the imaginary number, an icon of algebra, embodying the leaps of creative imagination that allowed numbers to break the shackles of mere magnitude. And finally e, the mascot of calculus, a symbol of motion and change.</p>

    <p>When I was a boy, my dad told me that math is like a tower. One thing builds on the next. Addition builds on numbers. Subtraction builds on addition. And on it goes, ascending through algebra, geometry, trigonometry and calculus, all the way up to “higher math” — an appropriate name for a soaring edifice.</p>

    <p>But once I learned about infinite series, I could no longer see math as a tower. Nor is it a tree, as another metaphor would have it. Its different parts are not branches that split off and go their separate ways. No — math is a web. All its parts connect to and support each other.</p>

    <p>Now back to the larger point: How do series like this serve to connect the various parts of math? To see this, we need to enlarge our point of view about formulas like:</p>
